## Hi there 👋 I'm Primo (PrimoPan)

I’m based in **HK/CN**, from **HKUST**.  
I build research-grade interactive systems — and I care about **readability**, **repeatability**, and **shipping**.

- 🎓 HCI researcher / creative technologist  
- 🧠 Interests: Health × AI, XR/MR experiences, human–AI interaction  
- 🛠️ Stack I ship with: **TypeScript / Node.js / React / React Native / C++ (UE5)**  
- 📍 Base: **HK/CN** (often working across research + production pipelines)

---

## 🔬 Research & community

I work with **许彬 (Pan Hui)** and **佟馨 (Xin Tong)** — within their research group/club — focusing on building and evaluating interactive systems that connect **people, media, and intelligent tools**.

**Conferences I care about / aim for**
- **CHI**, **UIST**, **CSCW**, **ISMAR**

---

## 🧩 Engineering habits (my coding signature)

- **Typed-first**: TypeScript with strict configs when possible  
- **Small commits**: incremental, reviewable changes; avoid “mega-commit”  
- **Readable diffs**: refactor + feature separated  
- **Docs as code**: README + runbook + architecture notes are part of the deliverable  
- **Quality gates**: lint + format + basic tests before pushing  
- **State-aware systems**: UI states & data flows are modeled, not guessed  

**Conventions I usually follow**
- Branch: `feat/...` `fix/...` `refactor/...` `chore/...`
- Commits: `feat: ...` `fix: ...` `docs: ...` `refactor: ...`
- Style: ESLint + Prettier; explicit naming; avoid clever hacks

---

## 🧰 Tooling & workflow

- Frontend: React / React Native (TypeScript), state-driven UI, i18n when needed  
- Backend: Node.js services, clean API boundaries, pragmatic logging  
- XR/MR: UE5 (C++/Blueprint hybrid), performance-aware content pipelines  
- Research: reproducible prototypes, study-ready instrumentation, clean data exports

---

## 🔧 What I’m building lately

- 🧪 Research prototypes with reproducible pipelines  
- 📱 Mobile + sensor-integrated experiences (HealthKit / wearables / CGM workflows)  
- 🦋 Large-space MR guidance systems (ASR/TTS + retrieval pipelines)  
- 🎮 UE5 interaction prototypes (C++ where it matters, Blueprint where it saves time)

---

## 📌 Featured work

I pin repos that demonstrate:
- clear architecture + runnable setup
- user/study relevance (not just demos)
- commit hygiene + docs that are actually useful

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

I’m open to collaborations around:
- HCI systems papers (CHI / UIST / CSCW / ISMAR)
- research tooling & prototypes
- XR/MR + AI experiences
