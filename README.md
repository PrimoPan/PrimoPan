## Hi there 👋 I'm Primo (PrimoPan)

I build research-grade interactive systems — and I care about *readability, repeatability, and shipping*.

- 🎓 HCI researcher / creative technologist  
- 🧠 Focus: Health x AI, XR/MR experiences, human–AI interaction  
- 🛠️ Stack I ship with: TypeScript / Node.js / React / React Native  
- 📍 Based in Asia (SG/CN), collaborating globally

### 🧩 Engineering habits (the stuff I do even when nobody is watching)

- **Typed-first**: TypeScript everywhere; strict configs when possible
- **Small commits**: incremental, reviewable changes; avoid “mega-commit”
- **Readable diffs**: prefer refactor + feature separated
- **Docs as code**: README, architecture notes, and “how to run it” are part of the deliverable
- **Quality gates**: lint + formatting + basic tests before pushing
- **Design thinking in code**: APIs & UI states are modeled, not guessed

**Conventions I usually follow**
- Branch: `feat/...` `fix/...` `refactor/...` `chore/...`
- Commit messages: `feat: ...` `fix: ...` `docs: ...` `refactor: ...`
- Code style: ESLint + Prettier; explicit naming; avoid clever hacks

### 📊 GitHub at a glance

<!-- More stable parameters: cache_seconds + v to reduce random broken caching -->

<!-- Optional: streak card (sometimes also rate-limited, but useful) -->

> If a card goes down sometimes, it’s usually the upstream service rate-limiting — not your README.

### 🔧 What I’m building lately

- 🧪 Research prototypes with reproducible pipelines  
- 📱 Mobile + sensor-integrated experiences (HealthKit / wearables / CGM workflows)  
- 🦋 Outdoor large-space MR guidance systems (ASR/TTS + RAG)  
- 🌐 WebGPU / 3D interactive demos when the project calls for it  

---

### 📌 Projects (pin the best 4–6 repos on your profile)

I usually pin projects that show:
- clean architecture
- real users / studies
- “run it in 3 minutes” setup
- stable maintenance habits

---

### 🤝 Collaboration

I’m open to collaborations around:
- HCI systems papers (CHI / DIS / ISMAR)
- research tooling & prototypes
- XR/MR + AI experiences

📫 Reach me:  
- GitHub Issues / Discussions on relevant repos  
- (Add email / website / scholar link here if you want)

---

### ✨ Fun signals (optional)

- If a project has a `docs/` folder, I’m probably taking it seriously.
- If you see `scripts/` + `Makefile`/`pnpm` tasks, I’m aiming for reproducibility.
