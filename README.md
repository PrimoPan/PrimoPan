# Primo Pan (PrimoPan)

HCI researcher / creative technologist @ **HKUST** · **HK/CN**  
I build interactive systems that are **clear**, **reproducible**, and **deployable**.  
> Signal > noise. If it doesn’t help someone understand or run the work, I cut it.

## Now
- **Health × AI** systems + study-ready instrumentation
- **XR/MR interaction** (large-space guidance, multimodal interfaces)
- **Human–AI interaction** (evaluation, UX of intelligent tools)

**Ship stack:** TypeScript (Node/React/React Native) · UE5 (C++/Blueprint hybrid)

## Selected work
> Replace these with your best 3–4 proofs. One line each. No essays.

- **[Project / Paper A](#)** — what it enables + why it matters (1 sentence).
- **[Project / Paper B](#)** — key contribution + what you built/measured.
- **[Project / Paper C](#)** — system + evaluation highlight.
- **[Tool / Dataset / Demo](#)** — runnable + reusable.

## Research context
I work within the research group/club of **Pan Hui (许彬)** and **Xin Tong (佟馨)**, building and evaluating systems that connect people, media, and intelligent tools.

**Venues I aim for:** CHI · UIST · CSCW · ISMAR

## Collab
If you’re building anything around:
- HCI systems papers (CHI/UIST/CSCW/ISMAR)
- research tooling + instrumentation pipelines
- XR/MR + AI interaction prototypes

…open an Issue/Discussion on a relevant repo. I’m happy to talk if there’s a concrete question or a runnable artifact.

<details>
  <summary><b>How I build</b> (engineering habits)</summary>

- Type-first thinking: explicit data models, state machines when needed
- Small, reviewable commits; refactors separated from features
- Docs are part of the deliverable: README + runbook + notes
- Basic quality gates before pushing: lint/format + minimal tests
- Study-ready by default: logs, events, exports, and clear configs

</details>

<details>
  <summary><b>Toolbox</b> (when it matters)</summary>

- Frontend: React / React Native (TypeScript), state-driven UI, i18n when needed  
- Backend: Node.js services, clean API edges, pragmatic logging  
- XR/MR: UE5 (C++ where performance matters, Blueprint where it saves time)  
- Research: reproducible prototypes, clean data exports, evaluation-friendly pipelines
